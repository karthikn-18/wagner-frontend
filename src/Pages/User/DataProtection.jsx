The agreement can be accessed at  <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools"><span className='colouredtext'>https://de-de.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools</span></a>  . According to this, we are particularly responsible for fulfilling the information obligations in accordance with Art. 13, 14 GDPR, for compliance with the security requirements of Art. 32 GDPR with regard to the correct technical implementation and configuration of the service and for compliance with the obligations under Art. 33, 34 GDPR, insofar as a breach of the protection of personal data affects our obligations under the agreement on joint processing. Meta is responsible for enabling the rights of data subjects in accordance with Art. 15 - 20 GDPR, for complying with the security requirements of Art. 32 GDPR with regard to the security of the service and for complying with the obligations under Art. 33, 34 GDPR, insofar as a breach of the protection of personal data affects Meta's obligations under the joint processing agreement.
                                The purpose of the application is to target website visitors with interest-based advertising on the social networks Facebook and Instagram. For this purpose, the Meta remarketing tag has been implemented on the website. This tag establishes a direct connection to the Meta servers when you visit the website. This transmits to the Meta server which of our pages you have visited. Meta assigns this information to your personal Facebook and/or Instagram user account. When you visit the social networks Facebook or Instagram, you will then be shown personalized, interest-based ads.
                                The application also serves the purpose of creating conversion statistics. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on one of our ads and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag, as well as what actions were taken after being redirected to this website. However, we do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.
                                Your data may be transferred to the USA. For the USA, there is an adequacy decision from the EU Commission, the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework (TADPF). Meta has certified itself according to the TADPF and is therefore committed to complying with European data protection principles.
                                Your personal data will be processed with your consent on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time without affecting the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of your consent until the revocation.
                                You can deactivate the "Custom Audiences" remarketing function here.

                            <p>We use the Google Tag Manager of Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; "Google") on our website.
