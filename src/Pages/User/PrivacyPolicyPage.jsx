                            <h6>I. General terms and conditions</h6>
                            <h6>1 Basic provisions</h6>
                            <p>(1) The following terms and conditions apply to contracts that you conclude with us as the provider ( WAGNER Spezialschmierstoffe GmbH & Co. KG ) via the website www.classic-oil.com. Unless otherwise agreed, the inclusion of any of your own terms and conditions is hereby rejected.</p>
                            <p>(2) A consumer within the meaning of the following provisions is any natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that can predominantly neither be attributed to their commercial nor their independent professional activity. An entrepreneur is any natural or legal person or a partnership with legal capacity who, when concluding a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of their independent professional or commercial activity.</p>
                            <h6>2 Conclusion of the contract</h6>
                            <p>(1) The subject of the contract is the sale of goods </p>
                            <p>(2) By placing the respective product on our website, we are making you a binding offer to conclude a contract via the online shopping cart system under the conditions specified in the item description. </p>
                            <p>(3)  The contract is concluded via the online shopping cart system as follows:
                                The goods intended for purchase are placed in the "shopping cart". You can access the "shopping cart" using the corresponding button in the navigation bar and make changes there at any time.
                                After clicking the "Checkout" or "Continue to order" button   (or similar name)  and entering your personal data as well as the payment and shipping conditions, the order data will finally be displayed as an order overview.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you use an instant payment system (e.g. PayPal (Express/Plus/Checkout), Amazon Pay, Sofort, giropay) as your payment method, you will either be taken to the order overview page in our online shop or redirected to the website of the provider of the instant payment system.
                                If you are redirected to the respective instant payment system, make the appropriate selection or enter your data there. Finally, the order data will be displayed as an order overview on the website of the provider of the instant payment system or after you have been redirected back to our online shop.</p>
                            <p>Before submitting the order, you have the opportunity to check the details in the order overview again, change them (also using the "back" function of the Internet browser) or cancel the order.
                                By submitting the order via the corresponding button ("order with payment", "buy" / "buy now", "order with payment", "pay" / "pay now" or similar designation), you declare your legally binding acceptance of the offer, whereby the contract is concluded.</p>
                            <p>(4) Your requests for an offer are non-binding for you. We will make you a binding offer in text form (e.g. by email), which you can accept within 5 days (unless a different deadline is specified in the respective offer).
                            </p>
                            <p>(5) The processing of the order and transmission of all information required in connection with the conclusion of the contract is partly automated by email. You must therefore ensure that the email address you have provided to us is correct, that receipt of the emails is technically guaranteed and, in particular, that it is not prevented by SPAM filters.</p>
                            <h6>3 Special agreements on payment methods offered</h6>
                            <p>(1) Credit check
                                If we make advance payments, e.g. when paying by invoice or direct debit, your data will be passed on to Tesch Mediafinanz, Weiße Breite 5, 49084 Osnabrück, in order to protect our legitimate interests for the purpose of a credit check based on mathematical and statistical procedures . We reserve the right to refuse you the payment method by invoice or direct debit based on the result of the credit check.</p>
                            <p>(2) Purchase on account via Novalnet
                                When purchasing on account, the invoice amount is due for payment to our external partner, Novalnet AG, no later than the calendar day stated on the invoice.
                                In this case, you can only pay to Novalnet AG with a debt-discharging effect.
                                Even when purchasing on account via Novalnet AG, we remain responsible for general customer inquiries, e.g. about the goods, delivery times, shipping, returns, complaints, cancellation notices or credit notes. This payment method is only available to customers from Germany. Novalnet AG checks and evaluates your information and, if there is a legitimate reason, exchanges data with other companies and credit agencies (credit check). If your creditworthiness is not guaranteed, Novalnet AG can refuse to allow you to purchase on account and will point out alternative payment options.</p>
                            <h6>(3) SEPA direct debit </h6>
                            <p>When paying by SEPA direct debit, you authorize us to collect the invoice amount from the specified account by issuing a corresponding SEPA mandate.

                                The direct debit will be collected within 2-7 days after the contract is concluded.

                                The deadline for sending the pre-notification is reduced to 5 days before the due date. You are obliged to ensure that there are sufficient funds in the account on the due date. In the event of a direct debit being returned due to your fault, you will be responsible for the bank fee incurred.</p>
                            <h6>4 Right of retention , retention of title</h6>
                            <p>(1) You can only exercise a right of retention if it concerns claims from the same contractual relationship.</p>
                            <p>(2) The goods remain our property until the purchase price has been paid in full.</p>
                            <p>(3)  If you are an entrepreneur, the following applies in addition:</p>
                            <p>(a) We retain title to the goods until all claims from the current business relationship have been settled in full. Before ownership of the reserved goods has been transferred, pledging or transferring ownership as security is not permitted.
                            </p>
                            <p>(b) You can resell the goods in the ordinary course of business. In this case, you hereby assign to us all claims in the amount of the invoice amount that arise from the resale; we accept the assignment. You are also authorized to collect the claim. However, if you do not properly meet your payment obligations, we reserve the right to collect the claim ourselves.</p>
                            <p>(c) If the reserved goods are combined or mixed, we acquire joint ownership of the new item in the ratio of the invoice value of the reserved goods to the other processed items at the time of processing.</p>
                            <p>(d) We undertake to release the securities to which we are entitled at your request to the extent that the realisable value of our securities exceeds the claim to be secured by more than 10%. The selection of the securities to be released is our responsibility.</p>
                            <h6>5 Warranty</h6>
                            <p>(1) The statutory liability rights for defects apply.</p>
                            <p>(2)  As a consumer, you are requested to check the goods immediately upon delivery for completeness, obvious defects and transport damage and to inform us and the freight forwarder of any complaints as soon as possible. If you do not do this, this will have no effect on your statutory warranty claims.</p>
                            <p>(3)  If a feature of the goods deviates from the objective requirements, the deviation is only deemed to have been agreed if you were informed of this by us before the contract was concluded and the deviation was expressly and separately agreed between the contracting parties.</p>
                            <p> (4) If you are an entrepreneur, the following applies, deviating from the above warranty provisions:</p>
                            <p>(a)   Only our own information and the manufacturer's product description are deemed to be agreed as the quality of the goods, but not other advertising, public praise and statements by the manufacturer.</p>
                            <p>(b)  In the event of defects, we will provide a warranty by repair or replacement at our discretion. If the remedy of the defect fails, you can demand a reduction in price or withdraw from the contract at your discretion. The remedy of the defect is deemed to have failed after a second unsuccessful attempt, unless the type of goods or the defect or other circumstances indicate otherwise. In the event of repair, we do not have to bear the increased costs that arise from transporting the goods to a location other than the place of performance, provided that the transport does not correspond to the intended use of the goods.</p>
                            <p>(c)   The warranty period is one year from delivery of the goods. The shortening of the period does not apply:<br />- to damages attributable to us that result from injury to life, body or health and to other damages caused intentionally or through gross negligence;<br />
                                - to the extent that we have fraudulently concealed the defect or have given a guarantee for the quality of the item;<br />
                                - to items that have been used for a building in accordance with their usual use and have caused its defectiveness;<br />
                                - in the case of statutory recourse claims that you have against us in connection with warranty rights.</p>

                            <h6>6 Choice of law, place of performance, place of jurisdiction</h6>
                            <p>(1)  German law applies. For consumers, this choice of law only applies insofar as it does not deprive them of the protection granted by mandatory provisions of the law of the state of the consumer's habitual residence (favorability principle).</p>
                            <p>(2)  The place of performance for all services arising from the business relationship with us and the place of jurisdiction is our registered office, provided that you are not a consumer but a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law. The same applies if you do not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or the EU or if your place of residence or habitual residence is not known at the time the action is brought. The right to also bring the case before a court in another legal place of jurisdiction remains unaffected.
                            </p>
                            <p>(3)  The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods expressly do not apply.</p>
